This is the "MEMORY FLIP GAME" 
It is built with the JavaScript DOM manipulation method.
Game Rules:
If two same cards are opened then it's a match. 
If two cards match, they remain face up and if they don't match, they flip back to same old position.
A reset button clears the board and starts the game new.
